\usage{
fisheye_fgc(
  coords,
  cx = 0,
  cy = 0,
  r_in = 0.34,
  r_out = 0.5,
  zoom_factor = 1.5,
  squeeze_factor = 0.3,
  revolution = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{A matrix or data frame with at least two columns representing x and y coordinates.}

\item{cx, cy}{Numeric. The x and y coordinates of the fisheye center (default = 0, 0).}

\item{r_in}{Numeric. Radius of the focus zone (default = 0.34).}

\item{r_out}{Numeric. Radius of the glue zone boundary (default = 0.5).}

\item{zoom_factor}{Numeric. Expansion factor applied within the focus zone (default = 1.5).}

\item{squeeze_factor}{Numeric in (0,1]. Compression factor applied within the glue zone
(smaller values = stronger compression, default = 0.3).}

\item{revolution}{Numeric. Optional rotation factor applied in the glue zone. Positive values
rotate counter-clockwise, negative values clockwise (default = 0.0).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with two columns (\code{x_new}, \code{y_new}) of transformed coordinates.
Additional attributes:
\itemize{
\item \code{"zones"}: character vector classifying each point as \code{"focus"}, \code{"glue"}, or \code{"context"}.
\item \code{"original_radius"}: numeric vector of original radial distances.
\item \code{"new_radius"}: numeric vector of transformed radial distances.
}
}
\description{
Transforms 2D coordinates using a \strong{Focus–Glue–Context (FGC) fisheye transformation}.
The function expands points inside a focus region, compresses points in a glue region,
and leaves the surrounding context unchanged. Optionally, a rotational "revolution"
can be added to the glue region to produce a swirling effect.
}
\details{
This function operates in three radial zones around a chosen center:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Focus zone (r <= r_in)}: expands distances from the center using \code{zoom_factor},
but does not exceed the \code{r_in} boundary.
\item \strong{Glue zone (r_in < r <= r_out)}: compresses distances using a power-law defined
by \code{squeeze_factor}, then remaps them to smoothly connect focus and context zones.
\item \strong{Context zone (r > r_out)}: coordinates remain unchanged.
}

Optionally, points in the glue zone can be rotated (\code{revolution}) to emphasize continuity.

\examples{
# Create a set of example coordinates
grid <- create_test_grid(range = c(-1, 1), spacing = 0.1)

# Apply FGC fisheye with expansion and compression
transformed <- fisheye_fgc(grid, r_in = 0.34, r_out = 0.5, zoom_factor = 1.3, squeeze_factor = 0.5)

# Plot original vs transformed
plot_example_fgc(grid, transformed, r_in = 0.34, r_out = 0.5)
