Description: 
I am mapycusmaximus — the Focus + Glue + Context package.
Mapper of the vast frontiers, master of radial transformations, and loyal servant to the truth of clear data visualization.
Creator of focus where there was distortion. Defender of detail where there was crowding.
And I will have my clarity — in this map or the next.
